<h2 id="heading3"> Brief description of research works: </h2>
<p> Here, I elaborate on my Ph.D. research projects that mostly focussed on twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and other supermoir´ e structures. For example, the topical review [D. Aggarwal, R. Narula, and S. Ghosh, “A primer on twistronics: a massless dirac fermion’s journey to moir´e patterns and f lat bands in twisted bilayer graphene”, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 35, 143001 (2023)] starts from the details of a massless Dirac fermion in various superlattice potentials that causes the appearance of the clones of such Dirac points in the energy spectrum. Further, we reviewed the moir´ e patterns in graphene over hexagonal Boron nitride (hBN) and tBLG and showed the details of various effective continuum models like the Bistritzer and MacDonald model and its special case of chiral symmetric Hamiltonian. At the end, we also provided a number of important theoretical and experimental works in tBLG and some other systems like twisted double bilayer graphene, twisted trilayer graphene etc. In the process of writing this review, I exhaustively covered a significant literature survey in twistronics while working out each and every detail. </p>

<p> Alongside this review, we thought about the problem of a moir´e system such as a tBLG in the presence of such a superlattice potential having same moir´e periodicity and then we came up with the idea of the ”moir´e fractals in twisted graphene layers” [D. Aggarwal, R. Narula, and S. Ghosh, “Moir´e fractals in twisted graphene layers”, Phys. Rev. B 109, 125302 (2024)]. The fractals like hierarchy emerge when a tBLG is subjected to a sequence of such moir´e periodic potentials and we dubbed them as moir´e fractals. For this, we studied a number of papers on fractals to analytically obtain various affine mappings that gave the required fractal generator of a commensurate supermoir´e pattern. In order to get the meaning to an expression in this work, we also studied various papers in a very different field of economical geography and implemented them to bring out an interesting connection between the arrangement of central places in Central Place theory and the hexagonal structure of commensurate supermoir´ e systems. We also did the literature survey of various supermoir´ e systems in order to show that the effective continuum model of such systems can be written as the model Hamiltonian of moir´ e fractals and a periodic perturbation. </p>

<p> In collaboration with another Ph.D. student in the same group, we investigated the optical properties of tBLG and compared them to its perfectly aligned counterpart and single layer graphene. Here, I contributed to develop various codes to calculate the relevant band structures and the optical matrix elements. Out of the two works, one is published [D. Arora, D. Aggarwal, S. Ghosh, and R. Narula, “Interference effects in polarization-controlled rayleigh scattering in twisted bilayer graphene”, Phys. Rev. B 107, 205423 (2023)], and the other is available as a preprint [D. Arora, D. Aggarwal, S. Ghosh, and R. Narula, Photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene, 2023]. </p>

<p> Now, since the lattice relaxations are necessary to include in the effective continuum models to get an accurate low-energy description of a moir´e systems like tBLG, therefore we are extending the idea of the moir´e fractals by investigating the effects of lattice relaxation-induced strain field on moir´ e fractals. During my preliminary training before delving into the actual research problems, I have developed strong analytical skills such as
<ul>
<li> <i> Single-particle studies </i>: I reproduced many single-particle results for a massless Dirac fermion in different superlattice potentials. I studied different moir´e systems such tBLG, twisted double bilayer graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides etc where I calculated the band structures and related properties like density of states, probability densities etc. Some of these results are already published in the topical review. </li>
<li> <i> Many-bodytechniques </i>: In the many-body techniques, I calculated the zero- and finite temperature Green’s functions for single and bilayer graphene to obtain correlation functions such as densitydensity correlation function and further calculated the vacuum polarization as a function of the transfer wave vector q frequency ω. </li>
<li> <i> Computational work </i>: To obtain the band structures and the dependent properties such as density of states, probability density. I learned to write the codes from scratch using languages like Python, Matlab, and Wolfram Mathematica.
